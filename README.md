Artificial Intelligence vs. Augmented Intelligence
       - for self driving car u require 3 types of intelligence 
           1.Human intelligence - intelligence you need to operate the vihicle, turn the steering wheel, to check mirrors.
           2.Artificial Intelligence - turn on self driving care feature. Now the car stayed on its lane, keep aprropriate distance from the vehicle in front, and maintained a proper speed. No input from a driver 
           3.Augumented Itelligence - when i get off the highway, i used a third forn of intelligence, augumented intelligence, that tool the form of all the driver assist features in the vehicle.
