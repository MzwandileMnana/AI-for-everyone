# AI-for-everyone

- What is AI : Augmented intelligence extending human capabilities.
           : Task completion beyond human and machine capabilities.
- Methods to develop machine learning models:
            -Supervised learning.
            -Unsupervised learning.
            -Reinforcement learning.
- Types of AI:
           - Weak (narrow) AI: Specific domains.
            - Strong (generalized) AI : Diverse capabilities across unrelated task.
           - Super(conscious) AI : Human-level consciousness

Artificial Intelligence vs. Augmented Intelligence
       - for self driving car u require 3 types of intelligence 
           1.Human intelligence - intelligence you need to operate the vihicle, turn the steering wheel, to check mirrors.
           2.Artificial Intelligence - turn on self driving care feature. Now the car stayed on its lane, keep aprropriate distance from the vehicle in front, and maintained a proper speed. No input from a driver 
           3.Augumented Itelligence - when i get off the highway, i used a third forn of intelligence, augumented intelligence, that tool the form of all the driver assist features in the vehicle.
