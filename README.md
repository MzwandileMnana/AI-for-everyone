Artificial Intelligence vs. Augmented Intelligence
       - for self driving car u require 3 types of intelligence 
           1.Human intelligence - intelligence you need to operate the vihicle, turn the steering wheel, to check mirrors.
           2.Artificial Intelligence - turn on self driving care feature. Now the car stayed on its lane, keep aprropriate distance from the vehicle in front, and maintained a proper speed. No input from a driver 
           3.Augumented Itelligence - when i get off the highway, i used a third forn of intelligence, augumented intelligence, that tool the form of all the driver assist features in the vehicle.

## NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING, SPEECH, AND COMPUTER VISION 

                        # NLP ( NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING ) : Is a subset of AI that Enables computers to :
                        - Comprehend, interpret, and produce natural language or Human language.
                        - NLP uses Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms to discern a word's sematic meaning. it does this by deconstructing sentences grammatically, relationally, and structurally, and understanding the context of use.
                        - NLP also understand intent and emotion recognition : Detects frustration, confusion, or irritation.
                        - NLP by understanding real intent : infers meaning through liguistic models and algorithms
                        - NLP is broken down into many subcategories related to audio and visual task.
                        # For computers to communicate in natural language, they should be able to : 
                              - Convert speech into Text
                              - Convert text into speech

                              #- Lets understand Speech-to-Text (STT) : Changes spoken words to written words using neural networks
                              #- Text-to-Speech (TTS) also known as speech sythesis : 
                                -Lets understand how neural networks enables TTS. First, one neural network learns a person's voice by analyzing many voice samples. Then a second neural network generates new audio and checks with the first network to see if it matches the original voice. If it doesnt, the second network adjust the audio and tries again. this process continues until the generated voice sounds natural and matches the original. Together, STT and TTS enable seameless human machine interaction through natural language....Example Google Language.

                                -NLP can also generate STT and TTS technologies for various applications :
                              ##- In customer support , STT transcribes queries. NLP understand these queries and generate responses, and TTS delivers them.


                              ##Computer Vision : IT is a field of artiifcial intelligence that empowers machines to interpret and comprehend visual data. it analyzes picture or video data to derive significant conclusions and make judgements. Computer vision is a technology that bridges the digital and physical worlds. For instance, it allows self-driving cars to understand and interprete their surroundings.

                              ## Neural networks are crucial in advancing computer vision applications like :
                              - image classification ( involves dividing images into pre-defined categories. 
                              
                              - object  detection ( facilitated by algorithms such as YOLO or you only look once and Faster R-CNN, not only recognizes objects, but also alocate them within images, making essential for areas like surveillance and autonomous vehicles.
                              
                              - image segmentation ( further anlyze visual content by dividing images into meaningful segments. It provides detailed labeling for each pixel, distinguishing betwen various industries.)

                              ## Examples
                                           - Computer vision is deployed by Amazon, Walmart, and Alibaba for inventory management and personalize shopping experiance, optimizing operations and enhancing customer satisfaction. Used by Toyota, Siemens, and Bosch integrate computer vision into production lines for quality control and automation, ensuring product consistency and efficiancy.
