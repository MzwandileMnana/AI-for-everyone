# AI-for-everyone

- What is AI : Augmented intelligence extending human capabilities.
           : Task completion beyond human and machine capabilities.
- Methods to develop machine learning models:
            -Supervised learning.
            -Unsupervised learning.
            -Reinforcement learning.
- Types of AI:
           - Weak (narrow) AI: Specific domains.
            - Strong (generalized) AI : Diverse capabilities across unrelated task.
           - Super(conscious) AI : Human-level consciousness

Artificial Intelligence vs. Augmented Intelligence
       - for self driving car u require 3 types of intelligence 
           1.Human intelligence - intelligence you need to operate the vihicle, turn the steering wheel, to check mirrors.
           2.Artificial Intelligence - turn on self driving care feature. Now the car stayed on its lane, keep aprropriate distance from the vehicle in front, and maintained a proper speed. No input from a driver 
           3.Augumented Itelligence - when i get off the highway, i used a third forn of intelligence, augumented intelligence, that tool the form of all the driver assist features in the vehicle.


- AI COMMON USE CASES AND BENEFITS IN OUR DAILY LIVES;
     - Personalized content on social media feed customize in your preferences.
     - how does online store know what are the product you would like to purchase.
     - or how the temperature and lights automatically adjust themselves.
     - Few benefits of AI in our daily lives :
                        - provides personalized experiences.

                       - Lightning control
                       - Security alert notification
   
- ENABLING PERSONALIZATION
           recommender system is used to analyze big data and then produce recommendation.
      Social media platforms (e.g facebook, instagram) they personalized content based on user interest.
  
10 Everyday AI and Machine Learning Use Cases:
  1.Text-based quieries can be handle by chabots, which act as victual agents that many business provide on their e-commerce sites.
    
  
# Module 
Amazon uses the Titan model to manage content.
An image recognition system inspects products for defects on assembly lines, ensuring that only top-quality products are delivered to customers.



- types of Large Language Models:
                 -claude model
                 - Llama model
                 - GPT-4 model
                 - Titan Model
  
- Supervised learning is a machine learning technique where models are trained using labeled datasets.
- Unsupervised learning this type of machine learning learns from data without human supervision. it uses self learning algorithms to structure information based on similarities, differences and patterns in data.

- AI can be divided based on its strenghts
        - Weak (narrow) AI: Specific domains
        - Strong(generalized) : Diverse capabilities across unrelated task
        - Super AI : Hypothethical AI that surpasses human intelligence in all domains.

  - Generative AI : is the type of AI that can generate content across various media, such as written text, images, audios, or videos.

  - LLMs are advance neural network architectures for processing and generating human like TEXT.
  - The capabilities of generative AI including diverse content creation capabilities, human like capabilities, and data augmentation.
 
- Neuro networks : Machine language model that simulates or mimic interconectivity of the human brain. they are design to recognize patterns and make decision in a manner similar to hoe biological neurons work together.
- Nuerons are organize into layers such as:
                    - Input layer: Receives the data.
                    - Hidden layers : Process the data.
                     - Output Layer : Proviveds the final decision or prediction.
